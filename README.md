## Project Week 8 

### Build a comment form

You've built a simple blog, your task now is to embellish it. Use database relationships to add a comments table. Add categories and tags to your posts. Add a form to create new comments. Add an edit page that populates the form with the post data and allows you save changes to the database.  

You can use Vercel Postgres or Supabase, so long as Postgres is the database.
